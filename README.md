Project files for creating Mostly Sounds, a sound board created by me for the 2024 Global Game Jam (Specifically Pig Squad).
The thing it creates is a sound board: click button, make noise. Some noises are actually png's and such, I had fun with it.

Built with Godot Engine v4.2.1.stable.mono.official

Tools used in creation:
* Krita for generating images
* Stacher for downloading YT videos
* DuckDuckGo for finding public domain images and sound effects
* Audible for splicing sound effects
* Ableton Live 10 suite for making music
* Godot 4.2 for game making software

I was moving pretty fast towards the end. there's some redundant stuff still, some extra functions in classes I coulda cleaned up. Biggest arch change would be to move a lot of the re-used functions into a library instead of them being copy-pasted everywhere.
I also might have moved more things into being their own node. it was handy having the buttons on the main screen so I could customize their scripts and labels, but there's probably advantages I wasn't getting by having it all like that.
